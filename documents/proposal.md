# General description of project
> to complete a fully functional othello game 

#Goals of project
> make a fully functional othello game in oop and python<br>
> pretty sure someone has done this before in another language<br>


# Listing of features
> List all the features in the fully functional app - you may choose to work on a subset of this listing to produce a MVP (minimum viable product) given constraint of time
> ordered in urgency:<br>
> 1st goal: functional othello game -> flipping of pieces, game over, pieces, multiplayer only<br>
> 2nd goal: score tracking + basic ui<br>
> 3rd  goal: account storing in a local file, will be able to retrieve user data and winrate<br>
> 4th goal: use turtle or some weird library to get better graphics<br>
> 5th goal (if there is time): singleplayer ai that the user can play against<br>

# External Scanning
> Are there similar apps / codebase that you found online that is similar to your project?  Provide link(s) to these projects and outline how will your project be different?
> https://github.com/SidTheEngineer/Othello-OOP github project in java with actual graphics<br>
> i solemnly swear i will not copy this<br>
> my project will be different as it will store a user's winrate<br>
> if there is time, will also implement singleplayer ai that the above project does not have<br>

# Listing of Key Use Cases
