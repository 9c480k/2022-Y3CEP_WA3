# General description of project
> *to complete a fully functional othello game 

#Goals of project
> *make a fully functional othello game in oop and python 
> *pretty sure someone has done this before in another language 


# Listing of features
> List all the features in the fully functional app - you may choose to work on a subset of this listing to produce a MVP (minimum viable product) given constraint of time
> *ordered in urgency: 
> *1st goal: functional othello game -> flipping of pieces, game over, pieces, multiplayer only 
> *2nd goal: score tracking + basic ui 
> *3rd  goal: account storing in a local file, will be able to retrieve user data and winrate
> *4th goal (if there is time): singleplayer ai that the user can play against 

# External Scanning
> *Are there similar apps / codebase that you found online that is similar to your project?  Provide link(s) to these projects and outline how will your project be different?
> *https://github.com/SidTheEngineer/Othello-OOP github project in java with actual graphics 
> *i solemnly swear i will not copy this 
> *my project will be different as it will store a user's winrate 
> *if there is time, will also implement singleplayer ai that the above project does not have 

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> *playing othello 

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> *python modules 
> *how to store and retrieve data from files using python
